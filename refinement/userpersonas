User Persona #1: Chelsea Smith

Chelsea is a University of Washington graduate student living in the UDistrict.  She has taken out a lot of student loans in order to pursue her doctorate degree and is therefore trying her best to stay on a budget.  With living in Seattle, a city concerned about climate change and the environment, she is wanting to live a more greener lifestyle starting off with making her clothing shopping more sustainable and affordable.  In the past she has shopped at fast fashion stores purely for convenience and affordability, but is wanting to change her habits.  She attempted to research more sustainable options but failed to find any stores that fit her style or budget.  With this, she has reverted back to shopping at fast fashion stores until there is a more convenient way to shop sustainably.

User Persona #2: Walter 

Walter is a student at the University of Washington pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Informatics. He has been fortunate enough to secure multiple paid internships over the course of his education however he still has a strict budget. Walter supports several initiatives with the most prominent of them being saving our planet. He likes to shop at stores such as H&M. In efforts to transition into sustainable living, Walter is looking for an outlet that he can purchase clothing at without breaking the bank or our planet. Shopping online has never been Walter’s preference due to the lack of being able to try clothing on and getting the product the same day. Walter is looking forward to researching and finding an online retailer that believes in sustainable fashion along with providing a convenient and quick shopping experience.
